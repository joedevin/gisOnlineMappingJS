Creating a GIS map using JavaScript API for San Diego County

# Overview

I wanted to create a web app map that shows parcel shapes and then also federally owned public lands. 
2nd I wanted to highlight main CBP facilities to quickly see if they were surrounded by private or public lands.
This is solely focused on the San Diego County area.

I am using ArcGis API written in JavaScript to display the map and various markers. It is just for quick browsing to compare. 
The colored shapes are public Federal lands and the gray parcels are more privately owned lots of land. 

The purpose is to help me at work quickly identify the shapes of parcels around particular CBP facilities. I often work with 
these facilities at my job so this will prove handy.
